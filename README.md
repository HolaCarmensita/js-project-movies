# About this project

A multi-page React application built in collaboration using the TMDB API.

This project was developed in a team setting with the goal of building a dynamic movie browsing experience. The app fetches data from themoviedb.org (TMDB) API and displays a curated list of movies. Users can click on any movie to view a detailed page with more information, including backdrop images, overviews, and other relevant metadata.

The project emphasizes API integration, responsive UI design, and clean routing using React Router. While our team used the "Popular Movies" endpoint as a base, the app structure supports swapping to other endpoints like "Now Playing" or specific genres. Styling and functionality were inspired by a provided design, with additional improvements to accessibility and UX.
